# Version 1.0.9

Fixed issue players having access to the convert to wall tool in the drawing tools.

# Version 1.0.8

Fixed issue with snapping to a point when starting a line

And changed the freehand line colour to match the type of wall being drawn.

# Version 1.0.7

Fixed issue when snapping to the closest point.

Fixed issues with double-click to split wall

Added option to hold down CTRL and right click to toggle a door being secret.

Had to remove the option of swapping the hold down CTRL to continue drawing a wall option.  With changes to v9 it just wasn't possible to do tha any more.  I'm hoping witht he freehand draw wall option that this is a bit of a moot point as that function can mostly replace it.
